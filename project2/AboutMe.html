   color:#003729;">Howdy, my name is Ryan Hayes.
   I was born in Ohio, grew up in Arkansas, and moved to Michigan during high 
   school. I studied at the University of Arkansas for 3 years before moving 
   up here to be closer to my family. This is now my third semester attending 
   EMU and I am really enjoying the Computer Science program here so far.</p>
 
<p style="padding-left:70px; padding-right:70px; color:#003729">
   While I am not currently working,
   I spent years as a barista in Saline.
   This sparked the beginning of my coffee addiction. Lately, I spend most of
   my time napping or focusing on school. At times I find myself napping AT school.</p>

<p style="padding-left:70px; padding-right:70px;
   color:#003729;">I don’t have a whole lot of time to 
   pursue my hobbies lately but listed below are a few of them. Most of them are 
   pretty cliché but my mom says I’m special.</p>
   
   <ul style="padding-left:100px; padding-right:100px; color:#003729;">
	  <li>Music—I play violin, guitar, piano, and I am learning to play 
	  the drums. I spend a lot of the free time I do have working on 
	  music. I studied some music theory and I now use that to make and 
	  produce music on my computer using Ableton Live.</li>
	  <li>I've always thought this picture was cool: 
	      <a href="https://i.redd.it/0y0x2e6i6ws21.jpg"

		  the inside of a violin</a></li>
	  <li>Movies—These are a great way to relax and pass the time. I 
	  usually prefer mystery/horror films but really I enjoy anything! 
	  My favorites recently have been Parasite, Us, and Jojo Rabbit.
	  I am excited to see what 2020 will bring.</li>
	  <li>One of my favorite places to watch movies is the 
	      <a href="https://i.redd.it/5eltm9kccw701.jpg"
		  style= "color:#0E083B;">
		  State Theater</a></li>
	  <li>Games—I grew up playing card games with my grandpa, now I play 
	  games like Magic, Hearthstone, and Faeria. I am helping some 
	  friends create an online card game of our own! I also enjoy 
	  Munchkin, Catan, and DnD.</li>
	  <li>Hiking—While I have not been able to go hiking as often since
	  moving here from Arkansas, it is one of my favorite things to do. 
	  I am allergic to nature, so large expeditions happen rarely</li>
	  <li>My favorite place to hike is

   </ul>

		   padding-top:15px">Dreams &#38; Goals:</h2> 
<p style="padding-left:70px; padding-right:70px;
   color:#003729;">My priority right 
   now is to finish my Applied CS degree here at EMU and land a stable 
   job. I should have around 2 semesters left and may find some time for 
   an internship. While music is just a hobby right now, I wish to turn 
   it into some form of income in the future. I hope to one day have a 
   mini music studio in my house.</p>
   
<p style="padding-left:70px; padding-right:70px; 
color:#003729">No matter what, I want 
to help those around me and make them smile! It is so important to be 
happy. Also I would like to have a family of ducks one day.</p>
